## üñ•Ô∏è CLI Usage and `taps()`

psyflow includes a small command-line tool for creating a new project from the bundled template. From a terminal run:

    psyflow-init [PROJECT_NAME]

With no argument or when `[PROJECT_NAME]` matches the current folder name, the template files are generated in place. Otherwise a new directory of that name is created next to your current path.

The same behavior is available programmatically through `psyflow.utils.taps()` if you prefer calling it from Python:

```python
from psyflow.utils import taps

# create or populate "MyStudy" using the default template
taps("MyStudy")
```

Both approaches use cookiecutter to copy the bundled `cookiecutter-psyflow` template into your project.
